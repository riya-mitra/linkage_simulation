# ModLab Digger Project Simulation
This simulation is a part of Modlab's digger project: a project focused on building a tunnel digging robot. 

This simulation uses MatplotLib to model a linking arm mechanism for the robot. The goal of the simulation is to optimize the lengths and angle positions for each link. We want to maximize the amount that the stroke of the arm propels the robot forward.
## Structure 
The simulation models 9 links:
- A, B, C, D, E, F + Pushdown 
- There are 2 D's and 2 E's
 
The following image is a sketch that shows the structure of the linkage and labels each link and angle:
